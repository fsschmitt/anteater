## Description

This project aims to automate cumbersome and boring manual steps that are required to be executed in BlueAnt for reporting hours.

In this initial stage, it **enables a user to upload the descriptions of the entire week** on a single page.

Other future functionality can be found on the [issues page](https://github.com/fsschmitt/anteater/issues).
